# Learning a11y practices through building Impact X - slide deck

Slide deck assembled using [reveal-md](https://github.com/webpro/reveal-md).

## Getting Started

Install reveal-md globally: `yarn global add reveal-md`.

Run `yarn install`.

Run `yarn server` - slide content will be served at http://localhost:1948

## Edit content

Slide content is found in `slides.md`.

## Edit theme

Styling is in `theme/style.scss`. Reveal-md expects custom theme styling only as css - run `yarn theme` to compile any changes to the `scss`.
